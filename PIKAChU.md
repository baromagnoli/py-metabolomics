# PIKAChU 

PIKAChU (Python-based Informatics Kit for Analysing CHemical Units) is a cheminformatics toolbox. Its funcionalities include: 
* parse molecules from SMILES, 
* visualise chemical structures and substructures in matplotlib, 
* perform Extended Connectivity FingerPrinting (ECFP) and Tanimoto similarity searches, 
* execute basic reactions with a focus on natural product chemistry.
