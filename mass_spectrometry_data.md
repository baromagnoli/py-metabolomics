# Handling chromatography-mass spectrometry data


|Name Package | Description| 
|:-----------:|:----------:|
| MSHub       |Imports data from multiple netCDF files to hdf5 database file, intra-sample (within sample) m/z peaks drift correction, ion Chromatogram noise filtering and baseline correction, inter-sample (between samples) chromatographic peak alignment, efficient detection of chromatographic peaks, total Ion Chromatogram visualization | 
| PythoMS     | Generates reconstructed single ion monitoring traces, overlays a predicted isotope pattern on input mass sprectum, generates a series of images showing mass spectrum and traces which can be combined into a video and renders a series of images which zoom into the y-axis to illustrate the dynamic range of mass spectrometers |
